/*** TX SETTINGS ***/
/*******************/
//Modify the channel order based on your TX: AETR, TAER, RETA...
//Examples: Flysky & DEVO is AETR, JR/Spektrum radio is TAER, Multiplex is AERT...
//Default is AETR.
#define AETR

//Uncomment to reverse the direction of the specified channel for all protocols
//#define REVERSE_AILERON
//#define REVERSE_ELEVATOR
//#define REVERSE_THROTTLE
//#define REVERSE_RUDDER


/*************************/
/*** BIND FROM CHANNEL ***/
/*************************/
//Bind from channel enables you to bind when a specified channel is giong from low to high. This feature is only active
// if you specify AUTOBIND in PPM mode or set AutoBind to YES for serial mode. It also requires that the throttle channel is low.

//Comment to globaly disable the bind feature from a channel.
//#define ENABLE_BIND_CH

//Set the channel number used for bind. Default is 16.
#define BIND_CH	16

//Comment to disable the wait for bind feature. This feature will not activate the selected
// protocol unless a bind is requested using bind from channel or the GUI "Bind" button.
//The goal is to prevent binding other people's model when powering up the TX, changing model or scanning through protocols.
#define WAIT_FOR_BIND


/****************/
/*** RF CHIPS ***/
/****************/
//There are 4 RF components supported. If one of them is not installed you must comment it using "//".
//If a chip is not installed all associated protocols are disabled.
//4-in-1 modules have all RF chips installed
//!!!If a RF chip is present it MUST be marked as installed!!! or weird things will happen you have been warned.
//#define A7105_INSTALLED
//#define CYRF6936_INSTALLED
#define CC2500_INSTALLED
#define NRF24L01_INSTALLED

//Low power is reducing the transmit power of the multi module. This setting is configurable per model in PPM (table below) or Serial mode (radio GUI).
//It can be activated when flying indoor or small models since the distance is short or if a model is causing issues when flying closed to the TX.
//By default low power is completly disabled on all rf chips to prevent mistakes, but you can enable it by uncommenting the lines below: 
//#define A7105_ENABLE_LOW_POWER
//#define CYRF6936_ENABLE_LOW_POWER
//#define CC2500_ENABLE_LOW_POWER
//#define NRF24L01_ENABLE_LOW_POWER

/*** GLOBAL ID ***/
/*****************/
//A global ID is used by most protocols to bind and retain the bind to models. To prevent duplicate IDs, it is automatically
// generated using a random 32 bits number the first time the eeprom is initialized.
//If you have 2 Multi modules which you want to share the same ID so you can use either to control the same RC model
// then you can force the ID to a certain known value using the lines below.
//Default is commented, you should uncoment only for test purpose or if you know exactly what you are doing!!!
#define FORCE_GLOBAL_ID	0x4E505043 // 'NPPC'

//Protocols using the CYRF6936 (DSM, Devo, Walkera...) are using the CYRF ID instead which should prevent duplicated IDs.
//If you have 2 Multi modules which you want to share the same ID so you can use either to control the same RC model
// then you can force the ID to a certain known value using the lines below.
//Default is commented, you should uncoment only for test purpose or if you know exactly what you are doing!!!

//#define TX_CUSTOM		//Custom

// The lines below are used to set the end points in microseconds (µs) if you have selected TX_CUSTOM.
// A few things to consider:
//  - If you put too big values compared to your TX you won't be able to reach the extremes which is bad for throttle as an example
//  - If you put too low values you won't be able to use your full stick range, it will be maxed out before reaching the ends
//  - Centered stick value is usually 1500. It should match the middle between MIN and MAX, ie Center=(MAX-MIN)/2+MIN. If your TX is not centered you can adjust the value MIN or MAX.
//  - 100% is the value when the model is by default, 125% is the value when you extend the servo travel which is only used by some protocols
#if defined(TX_CUSTOM)

// RX_Num is used for model match. Using RX_Num	values different for each receiver will prevent starting a model with the false config loaded...
// RX_Num value is between 0 and 15.

// Power P_HIGH or P_LOW: High or low power setting for the transmission.
// For indoor P_LOW is more than enough.

// Auto Bind	AUTOBIND or NO_AUTOBIND
// For protocols which does not require binding at each power up (like Flysky, FrSky...), you might still want a bind to be initiated each time you power up the TX.
// As an example, it's usefull for the WLTOYS F929/F939/F949/F959 (all using the Flysky protocol) which requires a bind at each power up.
// It also enables the Bind from channel feature, allowing to execute a bind by toggling a designated channel.

// Option: the value is between -128 and +127.
// The option value is only valid for some protocols, read this page for more information: https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/Protocols_Details.md
